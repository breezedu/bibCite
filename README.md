# bibCite

Got tired with editing citations by hands? 
This is a tiny BibTeX API, to insert bib format citations to reference.bib doc directly.

#Step 1, check a paper
#Step 2, copy the title of that paper
#Step 3, paste the title into bibCite
#Step 4, a bibTeX formated reference will be in the copyboard
#Step 5, insert the bibTeX formated reference to the reference.bib doc as a new reference. 

Have fun!
